# Snake  Game - Turtles module

## Overview
The goal with this coding exercise was to create the classic arcade game snake using the turtles module. This involved using Object Oriented Programming to create the snake, generate food, and keep track of the score, including saving the highscore in an external file.

## What I learned
I used this task as a way to get more familiar with OOP practices and improve my problem solving skills. Some challenges I came up against include:
* Finding a way to get the snake to move as one entity
* Making sure the snake can't change direction before it has already started moving in it's new direction
